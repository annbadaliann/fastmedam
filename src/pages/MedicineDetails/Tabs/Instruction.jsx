        thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, agranulocytosis; long-term
        use - methemoglobinemia, hypochromic anemia, liver and kidney function;
        when used in high doses - hepatotoxic effects. When using paracetamol
        indications and in strict compliance with the recommended dosages of the
        risk of side effects is reduced. Use of paracetamol during pregnancy and
